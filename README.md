# Local Cricket Stats Assistant

A scraper and a stats analyzer for local cricket

A tool created to get better and more useful statistics for local cricket than other similar websites. Features include:

- See players stats filtered by season, club, grade, or segment (junior/senior), to better understand the players in your team

- Graphs for batting and bowling, featuring running average, and TIRA (twenty innings running average) can help you visualise players recent form

- Fun stats such as batting bingo, and [Nohit-Brohit Line](https://i.redd.it/ezgnsrztdaa11.png)

Can be especially helpful for captains to help work out batting orders, and bowling options. First time captaining or have new players to your team?

- See where they bat their best. Do they usually open the batting? Or bat somewhere in the middle order? Or do they just bat all over the place?

- See a breakdown of their dismissals. Are they getting out bowled and LBW a lot? Something you can help them work on at training?

- Or are they more of a bowler? Work out how many overs they usually bowl in a match/innings, to make sure you aren't over bowling them and risking injuries
