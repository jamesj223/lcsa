# Local Cricket Stats Assistant

A scraper and a stats analyzer for local cricket

A tool created to help get better and more useful statistics for local cricket than other similar websites. 

Especially helpful for captains to help work out batting orders, and bowling options. 

You can easily see players stats by season, club, grade, or segment (junior/senior), to better understand the players in your team. 

Graphs for batting and bowling, featuring running average, and TIRA (twenty innings running average) can help you visualise players recent form.

- See where they bat their best. Do they usually open the batting? Or bat somewhere in the middle order? Or do they just bat all over the place?

- See a breakdown of their dismissals. Are they getting out bowled and LBW a lot? Something you can help them work on at training?

- Or are they more of a bowler? Work out how many overs they usually bowl in a match/innings.
